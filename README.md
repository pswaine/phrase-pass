# phrase-pass
A utility to generate and reliably regenerate a strong password based on a phrase of 20 characters or more. Run every time you need to log into a site to avoid storing your password in files or online. Enter an identifier (e.g. "amazon" or "facebook") to make the generated password distinct per service.
